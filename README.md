## Welcome to Devin Dupaix's git page. I use this as a [reference library](https://github.com/djdupaix/software_engineer/wiki) and link some of the project repositories I contribute to outside of work. 

### About me:

I was born and raised in the High Rockies in the state of Utah. I currently reside near the Everglades in the state of Florida. I studied Economics and Criminology as an Undergrad and studied Software Engineering as part of my Masters in Information Technology.

I currently work as a Software Engineer for Emerson Network Power. I love to innovate and solve problems in a logical and efficient manner.
